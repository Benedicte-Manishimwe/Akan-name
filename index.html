        <h2>AKAN-NAME</h2>
        <p> Most people do know when their birthdays are but many of them don't know the exactly day , they were born.<br>There is a small application to find it out automaticaly instead of doing manual calculation or checking on the calendar.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the day of your brith, the application will display also your Akan name based on your gender;Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
