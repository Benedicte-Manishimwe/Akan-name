          <p> Most people do know when their birthdays are but many of them don't know the exactly day , they were
            born.<br>There is a small application to find it out automaticaly instead of doing manual calculation or
            checking on the calendar.
          </p>
          <p>Based on the day of your brith, the application will display also your Akan name based on your gender;Akan
            names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day
            name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
